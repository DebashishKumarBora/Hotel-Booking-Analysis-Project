# Hotel Booking Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing hotel booking data to uncover trends and patterns, identify potential issues, and suggest improvements for hotel management. By understanding these elements, hotels can enhance their operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Data Overview

The dataset comprises hotel booking information, including reservation status, hotel type, market segment, and various customer-related attributes. It includes data on thousands of bookings, providing a robust foundation for analysis.

## Research Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to:
1. Clean and preprocess the hotel booking dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns.
3. Derive insights and provide actionable suggestions based on the analysis.

## Data Cleaning

Several steps were taken to clean the data:
- Handling missing values by dropping columns with excessive missing data (company and agent) and rows with any missing values.
- Removing outliers in the ADR (Average Daily Rate) column to ensure more accurate analysis.
- Converting date columns to appropriate datetime formats for temporal analysis.

## Analysis and Findings

### Reservation Status Count

## Suggestions

- **Improving Booking Confirmation:** To reduce cancellation rates, consider implementing more flexible booking policies, clear and timely communication with guests, and better booking management systems.
- **Targeted Marketing:** Focus marketing efforts on high ADR segments such as "Corporate" and "Direct". Tailored offers and loyalty programs could increase bookings from these segments.
- **Seasonal Promotions:** Introduce promotions and special events during off-peak seasons to attract more bookings. Collaborate with local attractions and events to create compelling packages.
- **Enhancing Guest Experience:** Address common special requests proactively, especially in Resort Hotels. This could include offering personalized services and amenities that cater to frequent requests.

## Conclusion

Summary of Findings: The analysis revealed key insights into reservation status, hotel type cancellation trends, market segment distribution, ADR variability, seasonal booking trends, and special request patterns. These insights can guide strategic decisions to improve hotel performance.

Future Work: Further analysis could include customer satisfaction surveys, deeper dives into reasons for cancellations, and exploring additional data points such as guest demographics and feedback. Continuous data collection and analysis will help in making informed decisions and improving hotel management practices.
